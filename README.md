# pyced

A python wrapper package for the CEBAF element database (CED) web API.

## Overview 
A light wrapper that handles common queries to the CED.  Only a small portion of the CED web API has been
wrapped so far, including the Inventory call and hierarchical type checking.  Some of this was based on the existing
ced2gnn software.

## Installation

pip install git+'
